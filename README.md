# ML_Project2
End to End ML Pipeline Project


This machine-learning project predicts your math score based on different factors. The project is an end-to-end machine learning pipeline which is ready to deploy and since it is modularly coded it features reusability, can deal with environment standardization, and have respective pipelines for training, preprocessing and prediction which are then packages as pikle files to be used remotely. 

The initial step was to create a machine learning project in an ipynb manner and then convert it into modular coding to demonstrate the optimal file structure that contributes to clean coding.
